      - One root folder: sit_academy
      - One folder per week: week1
      - One folder per day: day1
    - Microhabit: Create checkpoints for your victories
    - Create a cheatsheet
      - `git status` & `git add --all` & `git commit -m "Function xyz is working"` & `git push`
      - `git log` & `git status` & `git diff`
      - [Beautiful documentation](https://gitexplorer.com/)

  - == vs ===
- [Variables](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/4WXAxyQZiEo/8cSwMwnisbp)
  - Variables are NOT values, variables POINT to values
  - let vs const
- [Scope](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/4WXAxyQZiEo/52TgjGqIVUV)
  - let&const vs var
    - `var` has functional scope
    - `let` and `const` have block scope
  - hoisting
BREAK
- Functions
  - declaration vs execution
